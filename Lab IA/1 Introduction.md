### <font color="#ffff00">What is computer vision?</font>

#definizione <font color="#00b050">Computer vision</font>
	Computer vision is a multidisciplinary field of study that enables computers to interpret and make decisions based on visual data. It involves the development of algorithms, models, and systems that enable machines to understand, analyze, and interpret images or videos in a manner similar to human vision. The primary goal of computer vision is to enable machines to gain information from visual data, allowing them to recognize patterns, objects, and scenes, as well as make decisions or take actions based on that information.
	$\quad$ 
	Key tasks in computer vision include image recognition, object detection, image segmentation, facial recognition, tracking, and three-dimensional reconstruction. Computer vision finds applications in various domains such as medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, surveillance, augmented reality, robotics, and more. The field leverages techniques from computer science, mathematics, machine learning, and image processing to develop systems that can extract meaningful information from visual data. 

### <font color="#ffff00">Can computers match human perception?</font>

No, but computers are better at "easy" things, an human are better at "hard" things.
